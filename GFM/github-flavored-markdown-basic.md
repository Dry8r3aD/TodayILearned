# What is GFM?
GFM is and abbreviation for "Github Flavored Markdown", and I will be using GFM for my TIL.
To be honest, I was trying to do an algorithm for my TIL, but i just knew that GFM is not easy as I thought. So, I decided to do a TIL about GFM today.
Hopefully, GFM becomes easier for me when I do TIL tomorrow.
