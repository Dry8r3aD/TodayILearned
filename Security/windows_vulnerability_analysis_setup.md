# Windows Vulnerability Analysis Setup

* This TIL is about setting up a environment for analyzing vulnerability in Windows OS
* Unlike Linux OS, Windows OS is not a open source, therfore it's kernel code is not opened to the public. (Although some old OS' like Windows XP's code is leaked :P)
* So, we need to prepare some stuff, like extra software, to analyze and work on some Windows Pwnable
